# Final Project – System Programming Lab (20465)

This repository contains my implementation of the final project in the **Systems Programming Lab (20465)** course at the Open University.

## Project Description
As part of the assignment, I developed an **Assembler** written in **C**, which translates a custom assembly language into binary machine code. The assembler supports label resolution, macro expansion, error handling, and memory mapping, according to the simulated CPU model provided in the project specification.

## Features
- Macro preprocessor (support for `macr` / `endmacr`)
- Symbol table creation (labels, `.entry`, `.extern`)
- Instruction parsing and encoding based on custom instruction set
- Support for `.data`, `.string` and instruction sets
- Output files: object code, values, externs
- Written using modular C code, including Makefile
